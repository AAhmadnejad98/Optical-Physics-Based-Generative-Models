Optical Physics-Based Generative Models


## üöÄ Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of **physics-inspired generative models** based on both **linear and nonlinear optical physics equations**. We bridge the rich mathematical structure of optical wave and ray equations with modern AI, enabling efficient and interpretable generative models.

The framework includes:
- Linear and nonlinear forms of the **Helmholtz equation**, **dissipative wave equation**, and **Eikonal equation**
- Nonlinear effects such as **Kerr nonlinearity**, **cubic-quintic interactions**, and **intensity-dependent refractive index**
- Robust, high-quality generative sampling for synthetic data and real-world images
- Tools for both generative modeling and physics inverse problems
